# Customer-Segmentation-Using-RFM

# Introduction

Businesses have this ever-lasting urge to understand their customers. The better you understand the customer, the better you serve them, and the higher the financial gain you receive from that customer. Since the dawn of trade, this process of understanding customers for a strategic gain has been there practiced and this task is known majorly as [Customer Segmentation](https://clevertap.com/blog/rfm-analysis/).
As the name suggests, Customer Segmentation could segment customers according to their precise needs. Some of the common ways of segmenting customers are based on their Recency-Frequency-Monatory values, their demographics like gender, region, country, etc, and some of their business-crafted scores.


# Understanding Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value

Recency, Frequency, Monetary values RFM is a marketing analysis tool used to identify a firm's best clients based on the nature of their spending habits, how often they transact and how recently they purchase from the company. It evaluate clients and customers by scoring them in three categories namely Recency, Frequency, Monetary. And this helps firms reasonably predict which customers are likely to purchase their product again, how much revenue comes from new ( versus repeat) clients, and how to turn occasonal buyers into habitual ones.


**The RFM model is based on three quantitative factors:**


`Recency`: How recently a customer has made a purchase

`Frequency`: How often a customer makes a purchase

`Monetary Value`: How much money a customer spends on purchases

`RFM analysis` numerically ranks a customer in each of these three categories, generally on a scale of 1 to 5 (the higher the number, the better the result). The "best" customer would receive a top score in every category.

These three RFM factors can be used to reasonably predict how likely (or unlikely) it is that a customer will do business again with a firm or, in the case of a charitable organization, make another donation.

# Brief  history of rfm
The concept of recency, frequency, monetary value (RFM) is thought to date from an article by Jan Roelf Bult and Tom Wansbeek, "Optimal Selection for Direct Mail," published in a 1995 issue of Marketing Science. RFM analysis often supports the marketing adage that "80% of business comes from 20% of the customers."

# Significance of Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value
`RFM analysis` allows a comparison between potential contributors or clients. It gives organizations a sense of how much revenue comes from repeat customers (versus new customers), and which levers they can pull to try to make customers happier so they become repeat purchasers.

Despite the useful information that is acquired through RFM analysis, firms must take into consideration that even the best customers will not want to be over-solicited, and the lower-ranking customers may be cultivated with additional marketing efforts. It works as a snapshot of the clientele and as a tool to prioritize nurturing
